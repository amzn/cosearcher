# CoSearcher

This repository holds the source code for the ECIR 2021 paper [Studying the Effectiveness of Conversational Search Refinement Through User Simulation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-72113-8_39).

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/amzn/cosearcher
cd cosearcher
scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

## Usage

```sh
# Qulac facets with patience = 3 and cooperativeness = 1.0
python3 src/main.py > dialogues.json

# S-Bing facets with patience = 5 and cooperativeness = 0.5
# Get your API_KEY at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-autosuggest-api.
# Free usage is restricted to one call every 3 seconds (--bing-sleep)
python3 src/main.py --facet bing --bing-key API_KEY --bing-sleep 3 --patience 5 --cooperativeness 0.5 > dialogues.json

# B-Bing facets with patience = 5 and cooperativeness decreasing from 1
python3 src/main.py --facet graph-bing --bing-key API_KEY --bing-sleep 3 --patience 5 --cooperativeness 0.5 --cooperativeness-fn dec > dialogues.json
```

These commands output a large JSON object containing all simulated dialogues and IR results. To extract all IR metrics for the entire simulation, use [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq):

```sh
jq .metrics dialogues.json
```

## Customization

Both the agent (class `Clarify`) and CoSearcher (class `UserSimulator`) use various components that inherit from abstract classes. You can customize the system by creating your own implementations of these abstract classes and modifying `main.py` to inject your implementations.

For example, you can create a *stubborn* answer generator by inheriting from `AnswerGenerator` as follows:
```python
# from src/answer_generation.py
class AnswerGenerator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def generate_answer(self, topic: clarify_types.Topic, facet: clarify_types.Facet, cooperativeness: float, similarity: float) -> str:
        pass

# your code
class StubbornAnswerGenerator(AnswerGenerator):
    def generate_answer(self, topic: clarify_types.Topic, facet: clarify_types.Facet, cooperativeness: float, similarity: float) -> str:
        return "no"
```

    abstract="A key application of conversational search is refining a user's search intent by asking a series of clarification questions, aiming to improve the relevance of search results. Training and evaluating such conversational systems currently requires human participation, making it unfeasible to examine a wide range of user behaviors. To support robust training/evaluation of such systems, we propose a simulation framework called CoSearcher (Information about code/resources available at https://github.com/alexandres/CoSearcher.) that includes a parameterized user simulator controlling key behavioral factors like cooperativeness and patience. Using a standard conversational query clarification benchmark, we experiment with a range of user behaviors, semantic policies, and dynamic facet generation. Our results quantify the effects of user behaviors, and identify critical conditions required for conversational search refinement to be effective.",
